    <h1>POPLAR ISLAND REGROWS in the BAY</h1>
    <h4>By 1998, the Chesapeake Bay's Poplar Island had dwindled to several pieces of fewer than 10 total acres -- from over 1,100 acres in the mid-1800s. Later that year, construction started to rebuild the island using clean dredged material from the Maryland Bay Channels, which allow ships to access the Port of Baltimore. Now the island has been restored to nearly 1,100 acres and plans have been approved to expand the island another 575 acres.</h4>
