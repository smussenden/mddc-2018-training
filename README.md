# mddc-2018-training

In this training session, I'm going to walk you through using two free, open-source storytelling tools from [Knight Lab](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/projects/), [Soundcite.js](https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/) -- a tool for embedding audio in-line in text stories -- and [Juxtapose.js](https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/) -- a tool for comparing changes in photographs.

You may already be familiar with [Timeline.js](http://timeline.knightlab.com/), an interactive timeline tool.
